# RoveApp

This is an Android app which allows users to rate business on accessibility. 

## **Structure**
The project is laid out according to MVP design pattern

### **Design**
The layout folder contains all of the xml files for designing the views in the app. There is a similar theme running throught the app and easy to use text boxes, rating bars, image uploader and map view for users to enter details in the app.

#### **Elements employed:**
I have used android studio to create the app with a JSON store to store all visits in the app. I have created a landing page view but have yet to implement authentication for user signup and login. I have added a rating bar to the RoveView to allow users to rate the loactions they have visited nut I have yet to implement this fully
